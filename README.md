# TriviaGame

FUNCTION //

The focus of this assignment was to dive into JavaScript and jQuery to help develop a responsive game. User selects to start game, then picks from 4 options to progress through 10 questions. The imagery and audio adds another level of immersion to the game 

USEFULNESS //

The concepts learned during this project will be benefitial for future assignments as I got a good grasp on  how to call functions, create actions based on user input, and display key information through div elements. 

NEXT STEPS //

There are still a few bugs in the game that I will want to hash out. I'd like to add more visual elements and provide the user with feedback throughout the game (instead of just at the end).
